# hash_hunter

hash_hunter is a simple Ethereum vanity address generator written in Rust. It is designed to be a proof of concept for generating Ethereum addresses with a specific prefix and suffix. The project is a work in progress and is not intended for production use.

the rust code is designed to max out cpu, the python is a little more considerate.

Preliminary setup finished, python/rust working but cython not fully integrated yet. This project is a work in progress, don't ever use the keys produced by it.

Cuidado loco!
