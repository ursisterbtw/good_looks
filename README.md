# hash_hunter

hash_hunter is a simple Ethereum vanity address generator written in Rust. It is designed to be a proof of concept for generating Ethereum addresses with a specific prefix and suffix.

main.rs is designed to max out cpu, main.py is a little more considerate.

Preliminary setup finished, python/rust working but cython not fully integrated yet.

Cuidado loco!

## Usage

cargo run --release
```
